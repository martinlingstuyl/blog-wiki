## SharePoint

Uppercase _S_ and uppercase _P_.

## URL

Uppercase. Plural is _URLs_, not _URL's_ (unless describing something that belongs to a URL)

In content for a general audience, use _address_ rather than _URL_. In content for a technical audience, don't spell out _URL_ on the first mention. If you have a reason to spell out _URL_, use _uniform resource locator_. Use _a_, not _an_, as an article preceding _URL_.

Use _of_ (not _for_) to describe the relationship of the word _URL_ to a resource.

### Example

* Search results include the URL of the page.
